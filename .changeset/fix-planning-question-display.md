Fix two issues with question display in planning mode:

- Questions sometimes stayed hidden behind the "thinking" view until the panel was closed and reopened. The live SSE `question` event could be missed (e.g. when the tab was throttled), and the only path that promoted the view was the live event. Add an 8s polling fallback that refetches the session while the view is in the `loading` state and transitions to `question`/`summary` if the server has already moved on, so a dropped event self-heals.
- Clicking "New Session" and then typing into the textarea jumped the panel back to the previous session's questions. The "resume on open" effect listed `loadSession` in its deps; `loadSession` is recreated whenever `connectToPlanningStream` changes, and the latter depends on `initialPlan`, so each keystroke re-ran the resume effect and reloaded the dismissed session. Track dismissed `resumeSessionId`s in a ref and drop `loadSession` from the effect's deps. Also guard the SSE `onThinking`/`onQuestion`/`onSummary` handlers against late events from a stale connection so they can't overwrite the new session's view.
