Make the `fn` / `fusion` global CLI install discoverable and self-serve from the dashboard.

- Settings → General now has a **CLI Binary** panel showing whether `fn` (or `fusion`) is on PATH, the resolved version, and a one-click **Install with npm** button that runs `npm install -g runfusion.ai` server-side. The panel also surfaces copy-to-clipboard install commands (`npm install -g runfusion.ai` and `curl -fsSL https://runfusion.ai/install.sh | sh`) for users with non-default npm setups, and reports a permissions hint when `npm install -g` fails with `EACCES`.
- A first-launch banner nudges users to install when the binary is missing; dismissal is permanent (per-browser localStorage).
- Fixed scheduled **Database Backup** automations whose persisted command was `fn backup --create` — those failed every run on hosts where the global bin was never linked. A new schema migration (v58) rewrites legacy `fn`/`kb`/`fusion` backup commands to `npx runfusion.ai backup --create`, matching the canonical seed in `syncBackupAutomation`.
- Added `detectFnBinary()` to `@fusion/core` so server-side code can resolve the right invocation prefix (`fn` > `fusion` > `npx -y runfusion.ai`) without baking a binary name into automations or generated commands.
